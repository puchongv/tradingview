# Gemini Conversation Log - 2025-09-15

## üìù Summary of Conversation

This log captures the conversation regarding the analysis of SQL queries for calculating rolling win rates.

### Key Points Discussed:

1.  **Resuming Session:**
    *   The user re-initiated the conversation after a potential disconnection.
    *   I confirmed my status and re-established context by reviewing the project's `agent-conversation-context.md` and `agent-project-requirements.md` files.

2.  **SQL Query Review:**
    *   The user presented an SQL query from `rolling_winrate_byhour.sql` for analyzing strategy win rate changes over time.

3.  **Comparative Analysis of SQL Scripts:**
    *   The user asked for a comparison between two different SQL scripts designed to analyze win rate changes:
        *   **My Script (`rolling_winrate_change.sql`):** Focuses on a time-series trend analysis, calculating a rolling win rate over a specific number of preceding *hours*. This is ideal for seeing if a strategy's performance is trending up or down continuously.
        *   **GPT Script (`rolling_winrate_byhour.sql` from user attachment):** Focuses on analyzing the average performance for each *specific hour of the day* (e.g., the average win rate for 9 AM, 10 AM, etc.) based on historical data. This is useful for identifying "golden hours" or "danger zones".

4.  **Conclusion of Analysis:**
    *   I concluded that **my script (`rolling_winrate_change.sql`)** is more effective for the user's stated goal of viewing **win rate change and trends over time**.
    *   The GPT script serves a different, albeit also valuable, purpose of analyzing performance patterns based on the time of day.

### üöÄ Next Steps Suggested:

*   Proceed with using the more suitable script (`rolling_winrate_change.sql`) to create visualizations in Metabase.
*   Modify or further refine the chosen SQL query based on user feedback.
