GPT Leaderboard Simulation
Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-10-02

This script mirrors leaderboard_simulation_v1 but is published under the
name "GPT Simulation" per request. It replays historical trades using the
leaderboard logic from PNL-fomula.sql (3-hour lookback, Top 5 strategies)
and measures realized PNL when executing only the signalled strategy|action
pairs.
